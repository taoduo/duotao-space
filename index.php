	<h1>Duo Tao</h1>
	<i>What we do for ourselves dies with us. What we do for others and the world remains and is immortal. (Albert Pike)</i>
	<p>I am born in Harbin, China. I have been an undergraduate at Carleton College since 2014. I study physics and computer science. </p>
	<p>I am passionate about science and technology. I wish I could know all of them; however, heretofore, I have mostly been studying cosmology, astronomy and gravitational waves (<a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO</a>). When I have time, I like to train my body (running, swimming, basketball, fencing etc.) and my mind (by learning new things). </p>
